  (Previous HVP System)

  Now part of Glick (GPU+Click) system. For old README from Click, read
  README.old

  Still under development.

  Stability:
    I can't guarrantee sucessful compilation and execution of commits
    from my laptop, but commits from my GPU node are runnable for
    most of time.
