Aiming\r\n    at 10Gbps line rate complex packet processing. Now can reach ~30Gbps SDN\r\n    forwarding, IDS router at 64B packets and 40Gbps starting from 128B on an\r\n    overclocked Core i7 930 machine with GTX 480 or Tesla C2070.\r\n  \r\n  Snap is still under development, master branch doesn't contain the latest\r\n    unstable change, checkout other topic branches such as \"mrg\" for new\r\n    functionality and elements.\r\n  \r\n  Weibin Sun (@wbsun)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
